    **About this Project:**  
    This interactive tool demonstrates key quantum phenomena‚Äîsuch as superposition, entanglement, wave-particle duality, and uncertainty‚Äîusing simple analogies and real-time visualizations.  
    The goal is to make complex quantum mechanics accessible and engaging for learners of all levels.

    # Spinning Coin (Superposition)

    st.markdown("""
    In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states at once, like a coin spinning in the air ‚Äî it's both heads and tails until it lands.

    **Visualization:**  
    The graph shows two states (Heads and Tails), each oscillating at different frequencies.  
    The superposition (combined state) is a mix of both, represented by the purple line.

    **Simple Explanation:**  
    Imagine a spinning coin. Instead of being just heads or tails, the coin is in both states at the same time ‚Äî this is quantum superposition.

    **Interactive Element:**  
    Sliders let you adjust the frequency of heads and tails to see how the superposition changes.

    When two particles are entangled, changes to one affect the other instantly, regardless of distance.

    **Visualization:**  
    Two particles represented as circles interact instantly even when separated.

    **Simple Explanation:**  
    Think of a magical connection where if you change one particle, the other changes too immediately, no matter how far apart they are.

    Use sliders to adjust the distance between particles and the strength of their entanglement.

    Particles like photons behave as both waves and particles.

    You cannot know both the exact position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.
